/*

intro :
#Inheritance defines an is-a relationship between a parent class and its subclasses.
Every non-private member of a parent class is visible inside the subclasses
if preceded by the keyword open.
: each class could only have one parent Class "eXtend" and infinite number of interfaces "implement"

#Interface  :
Interfaces establish an is, rather than an is-a,
relationship between the class and the interface.Unlike abstract classes, interfaces define a specific behavior rather than a template.

# Abstract Class :
You can see abstract classes as a mixture of interfaces and regular classes.
Abstract classes can have everything that interfaces have as well as properties and constructors.
Therefore, you can properly hold state in abstract classes, but you canâ€™t instantiate an abstract class.
You can think of an abstract class as a template.
